/**
 * This implementation of FileProcessingWorkflow downloads the file, zips it, and uploads it to a
 * destination. An important requirement for such a workflow is that while a first activity can run
 * on any host, the second and third must run on the same host as the first one. This is achieved
 * through use of a host specific task list. The first activity returns the name of the host
 * specific task list and all other activities are dispatched using the stub that is configured with
 * it. This assumes that FileProcessingWorker has a worker running on the same task list.
